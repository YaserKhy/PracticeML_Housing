# Welcome !
In this notebook, we will build regression models to predict houses prices based on some features like area, number of bedrooms, and number of stories.

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset/data) source is kaggle.

# Content
The notebook has 4 sections
- Data Exploration : where we browse some rows of the dataset and know its features and datatypes.
- Data Preprocessing : where we perform data cleaning, normalization, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis : where we explore our dataset and gain insights with graphs for better understanding.
- Model Building : where we build and evaluate machine learning models.
